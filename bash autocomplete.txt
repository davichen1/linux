Something that is a life-saver for me is to have bash cycle through the possibilities instead of showing a dumb list.

As bash is using readline for its auto-completion, add the following lines to your /etc/inputrc (Caution: /etc/inputrc contains the system-wide settings, so if you're the careful type, you might try this out in your own user's ~/.inputrc first!)

# mappings for making up and down arrow searching through history:
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\e[C": forward-char
"\e[D": backward-char

#Use [Tab] and [Shift]+[Tab] to cycle through all the possible completions:
"\t": menu-complete
"\e[Z": menu-complete-backward
then exit your terminal and open it again...

Example: When you have 3 files: file1, file2 and file3 and you type:

e fTabTabTab
it'll cycle through:

e file1
e file2
e file3
and when you want to go back, just hit Shift+Tab

when you type:

very-complicated-command with lots of command line parameters
and next time you need the same command, you just type:

very?
and it'll type for you:

very-complicated-command with lots of command line parameters
