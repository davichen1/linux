1 Change default resolution:

Setting the resolution of the virtual desktop
By default, the system will create a virtual desktop that is 3840x1600 pixels in size. To change this, add this line to your ~/.profile script:

export CHROME_REMOTE_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_DESKTOP_SIZES=1600x1200

(replacing 1600x1200 with your preferred size).

If the session is already running, you will need to restart it for this setting to take effect:

sudo /etc/init.d/chrome-remote-desktop stop

sudo /etc/init.d/chrome-remote-desktop start


2, change default desktop session.

 Create a virtual desktop session

Look in /usr/share/xsessions/ for the .desktop file for your preferred desktop environment.
For example, Cinnamon has a file named "cinnamon.desktop" with the following command: gnome-session --session=cinnamon
Create a file called .chrome-remote-desktop-session in your home directory with the following content:
exec /usr/sbin/lightdm-session "<YOUR_EXEC_COMMAND>"
Replace <YOUR_EXEC_COMMAND> with the command at the end of your .desktop file:
In the example for Cinnamon, the correct command is exec /usr/sbin/lightdm-session 'gnome-session --session=cinnamon'
Unity desktops require some additional code. The full command is DESKTOP_SESSION=ubuntu XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u) exec /usr/sbin/lightdm-session 'gnome-session --session=ubuntu'
Save the file called ".chrome-remote-desktop-session"​.

#Above worked for Ubuntu 16.04 with ubity and cinnamon installed, with some minor changes. See below:
konglab@SOP-1163:~$ cat .profile 
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022

# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin directories
PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
export CHROME_REMOTE_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_DESKTOP_SIZES=1920x1080
konglab@SOP-1163:~$ cat .chrome-remote-desktop-session 
exec /usr/sbin/lightdm-session "cinnamon-session-cinnamon"
konglab@SOP-1163:~$ 



########other untested online resources:
To fix this, please follow these steps:

Stop it:
 /opt/google/chrome-remote-desktop/chrome-remote-desktop --stop

Back it up:
cp /opt/google/chrome-remote-desktop/chrome-remote-desktop /opt/google/chrome-remote-desktop/chrome-remote-desktop.orig

Edit:  /opt/google/chrome-remote-desktop/chrome-remote-desktop

Change this to the size I wanted.
DEFAULT_SIZES = "1920x1080"

Change this to desktop zero which is the console.
FIRST_X_DISPLAY_NUMBER = 0

Comment this out so it doesn't increment for a new desktop.:
#while os.path.exists(X_LOCK_FILE_TEMPLATE % display):
#  display += 1

Comment this out so that it doesn't attempt to start a new display session since the console on desktop zero is already running :
      #logging .info("Starting %s on display :%d" % (xvfb, display))
      #screen_option = "%dx%dx24" % (max_width, max_height)
      #self .x_proc = subprocess.Popen(
     #    [xvfb, ":%d" % display,
     #     "-auth", x_auth_file,
     #     "-nolisten", "tcp",
     #     "-noreset",
     #     "-screen", "0", screen_option
     #    ] + extra_x_args)
      #if not self.x_proc.pid:
     #  raise Exception("Could not start Xvfb.")

Start it:
 /opt/google/chrome-remote-desktop/chrome-remote-desktop --start

DONE.  Now it attaches to Unity's existing X Server on display :0.﻿

Hello All,

We are excited to announce official Linux support in Chrome Remote Desktop with step-by-step directions provided in our Help Center article linked here. You can find instructions under Set up Chrome Remote Desktop > Enable remote access > Linux (Beta).

Take a look below for some helpful tips and basic troubleshooting recommendations from the development team to make the most of your Chrome Remote Desktop experience on Linux! 

Setting the resolution of the virtual desktop: By default, the system will create a virtual desktop that is 1600x1200 pixels in size. To change this, add this line to your ~/.profile script:

export CHROME_REMOTE_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_DESKTOP_SIZES=1024x768

If the session is already running, you will need to restart it for this setting to take effect:

sudo /etc/init.d/chrome-remote-desktop stop
sudo /etc/init.d/chrome-remote-desktop start


Having Trouble?

1. Running Chrome in the virtual session
The virtual session is set up so that, when you run Chrome from within the virtual session, it will be set up with a new profile. This is done because Chrome does not support using multiple X displays within the same profile. You can use Chrome Sync to synchronize your bookmarks and other settings within the virtual session.

2. Viewing the host service logs
The virtual desktop is created by the system init.d service “chrome-remote-desktop”. This service is started from the web-app when you enable remote connections. Each time this service runs, it creates a log file named /tmp/chrome_remote_desktop_... (the suffix contains a timestamp and a random string).

If the service fails to start (or only runs for a short while), this might be because the session is not properly configured. If this occurs, take a look at the log file.

If you have questions, please feel free to post in a new thread so someone from the Chrome team can assist you!!!
